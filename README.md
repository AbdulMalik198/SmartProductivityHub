A productivity tool built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **LocalStorage**. It combines tasks, notes, a daily planner, and a simple dashboard into one clean, responsive interface 
## 🧠 About the Smart Productivity Hub

The **Smart Productivity Hub** is a lightweight, browser‑based personal organisation tool designed to help users stay focused, structured, and productive throughout the day. Built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **LocalStorage**, it delivers a smooth, app‑like experience without relying on frameworks or backend services.

This project brings together the core elements of productivity into one unified interface:

- **Task Manager** for capturing and tracking daily to‑dos  
- **Notes Workspace** for storing ideas, reminders, and learning points  
- **Daily Planner** for scheduling time‑based activities  
- **Dashboard** for viewing simple productivity insights  
- **Smart Widgets** that display the current date and motivational prompts  

Everything is stored locally in the browser, so users can close the tab and return later without losing progress. The interface is intentionally clean and responsive, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

The Smart Productivity Hub is designed as a beginner‑friendly yet professional project that demonstrates core front‑end skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, data persistence, and UI layout — making it an excellent addition to any portfolio or CV.
